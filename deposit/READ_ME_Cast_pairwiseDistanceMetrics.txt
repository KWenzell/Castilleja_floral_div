Metadata for population-pairwise distance comparisons (color, geographic, genetic) for each taxa

Files: 
For C. sessiliflora: CASE_PW_gen4f_col_geo_SNPpca1-2_v3_2021-02-18.csv
For C. purpurea complex: CAPU_PW_gen4f_col_geo_SNPpca1-2_v3_2021-02-18.csv

For CASE_PW_gen4f_col_geo_SNPpca1-2_v3_2021-02-18.csv:
pop1= population code 1 (first in pairwise comparison)
pop2= population code 2 (first in pairwise comparison)
group= floral morph grouping (classed as divergent morph or typical morph)
morph= floral morph/ color (either typical, pink, or yellow)
corolla= corolla tube length class (either long or short), based on pop mean average >40mm (long) or < 40mm (short)
GenDistv2= pairwise genetic distance metric version 2, based on only fourfold degenerate sites, calculated in MEGA
ColorDist= Euclidean distance between population mean red, green, and blue (RGB) values, calculated using function dist()
GeodesicDist=  Geodesic distance (in m) between the Latitude and Longitude coordinates of each population pair, calculated using package geodist
GenDist_v3_SNP_pc1_2= pairwise genetic distance metric version 3, calculated as the Euclidean distance between population mean eigenvalues for eigenvectors PC1 and PC2 on a PCA based on SNPs
GeodesicDist_km= The same metric as GeodesicDist above, converted to units of kilometers from meters (x/1000)

w_bSp= classification of whether a given pairwise comparisons was made within species (within) and between species (between) of the C. purpurea complex
